## Learning Algorithm

The algorithm used actor-critic algorithm to train the agent on.

## Plot of Rewards

`checkpoint.pth` has a score of 30.

## Ideas for Future Work

The hyperparameters can be adjusted a bit more to improve the Agent score.
More agents can also be added to train simultaniously to solve the environment even quicker.
